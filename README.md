# Analyzing Amazon Stock and Morgan Stanley Investor Behavior (ms-coop-amazon)

In this project, my group and I analyzed the performance of Amazon's stocks between 2016-2020. We looked at the prices of the shares and factors which influenced prices such as company announcements and new business ventures. We also dissected Morgan Stanley's client behavior in comparison to the fluctuation in Amazon's performance.
